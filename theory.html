            <h3>Week 3</h3>
            <p>Last year, I really struggled with understanding JavaScript and APIs, partly because they weren’t explained properly on how to use them and when to use them, so I skipped the whole section on JavaScript and APIs. I have taken the initiative to try and learn as much as I need to know this year. As part of that, I’ve watched the revision videos, which I somewhat understand, but I believe doing it practically will propel me to understanding these concepts much quicker.</p>
            <p>For this week, I looked for inspiration for my internet art. Here's what I’ve found: <a href="https://www.arebyte.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwq-WgBhBMEiwAzKSH6FcTnsY8Gy8KbePGDC3A4QoRGzAIKvQtdGYetJFORkYbUpNksoYGDBoCJ50QAvD_BwELinks to an external site.Links to an external site." target="_blank">https://www.arebyte.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwq-WgBhBMEiwAzKSH6FcTnsY8Gy8KbePGDC3A4QoRGzAIKvQtdGYetJFORkYbUpNksoYGDBoCJ50QAvD_BwELinks to an external site.Links to an external site.</a> and <a href=" https://aoi.com/Links to an external site.Links to an external site." target="_blank"> https://aoi.com/Links to an external site.Links to an external site.</a> </p>
            <p>The first website is arebyte; this looks great visually, as you can see the 3D model creatures moving around. I think this is really nice and well designed as a concept for a website. The second website is AOI, which also looks visually pleasing because of its moving art and overall color theme. Both are inspiration and concepts I'd love to deploy on my own website. My first impression of internet art was that I thought it was the same as data art, but then I came to the realization that internet art is art distributed through the internet, unlike data art, where you manipulate data into art. So far, I like what I see from the example made in class.</p>
            <p>The reading "The Work of Art in the Age of the Internet" by David Carrier makes reference to Walter Benjamin’s The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction and challenges the concept of art, especially authenticity, because, according to Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction of a work of art is essentially defined by multiple copies, so it shatters the aura by interrupting these founding traditions. However, Carrier pushes back on this by saying, "The original physical object is now merely the source, just as the author’s manuscript is the source of a novel, and the reproduction has become a genuine replacement for that object. And so owning the original is like owning the manuscript of a novel—a thing of value for specialists but not for the general public." (Carrier, 2020:4-5). Both are valid points, and I agree with both perspectives.</p>

                <p>Convention and Context by Steven Mailloux discusses how conventions are dependent on context. He makes a valid point when he says, "We can discuss conventions as ways of acting or as accomplishments of meaning, not only in literary and critical texts but also in discourses circulating in other cultural and social spheres." (Mailloux,1983:409). What I understand this to mean is that conventions are not a set of rules that must be followed at all times, but rather that conventions work hand in hand with context. In any given context, there are a set of conventions to be followed. How do I relate this to my understanding of UI and UX? Similar to conventions, UI and UX have a set of conventions one has to follow when designing a website, but again, not everything will apply as context is important. Maybe the website you plan to create doesn’t have an "about" page, for example. This is why context is important.</p>

    <h3 class="subheading">Reflection_______Posts.</h3>

            <article>
                <p>IxD Process</p>
                <p>Goal Alignment: My goal is to create a personal website displaying all my work for the semester. It should contribute to my growth as a web developer and designer. It must showcase my creativity and understanding of what a website is and reflect my knowledge of coding with HTML and JavaScript. Moreover, it’s a website I want to show to some potential clients. So with that being said, I don’t have a specific target audience because, as I said, I want to show it to as many people as I want.</p>
                <p>Information Structure: Content Mapping: Content will be sorted in its appropriate category, e.g., if it's a blog post, it's under the blogs section. From then on, using knowledge of information hierarchy, the important elements or notes will be given higher preference as they are what the user engages with most of the time.</p>
                <p>CSS</p>
                <p>Picking up where we left off last week, we began working on our CSS coding for our website. This is where we start building the aesthetics and looks of our website. This is the glamourization part of the process, where things like color, font, layout, background, and image are stylized to give the website more life. The work I have done this week for the website was to implement a color scheme consisting of a white background paired with a toned-down green for the header and footer. The font I have chosen to use is Times New Roman for its slick and professional look.</p>
                <p>UI & UX</p>
                <p>Convention and Context by Steven Mailloux discusses how conventions are dependent on context.

Maybe the website you plan to create doesn’t have an "about" page, for example. This is why context is important.</p>
                <p>The Basic Principles of User Interface Design details important guidelines needed to be followed when making websites user friendly. These are rules that guide designers to make their UI better. Such as striving for clarity, as the main purpose of UI is interactivity between the user and website, this could be achieved by aiming for simplicity and being consistent. The list of things one can do to improve their UI design is endless, as this reading only offers the basics of user interface design principles but is a great place to start.</p>
